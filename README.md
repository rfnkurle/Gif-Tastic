<strong>About</strong><br>
This app uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. The GIPHY API is called using AJAX with JavaScript and jQuery used to change the HTML of the site. Click here to play!

<strong>Instructions</strong><br>
When the user types in a topic (in this case an art genre) and presses enter or clicks the "submit" button, a new "animal" button will be created in the HTML.

When the user clicks on an art genre button, the page will grab 9 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Above every gif, a rating is displayed (PG, G, so on).

<strong>Bonus Goals</strong><br>
This app is fully mobile responsive.

Additional gifs can be added to the page.

Each request should ADD 9 gifs to the page, and NOT overwrite the existing gifs.
